# Tech Company Orchestrator - User Guide

Welcome to the Tech Company Orchestrator! This project is designed to simulate the workflow of a tech company by orchestrating various agents to collaboratively process prompts and generate comprehensive outputs such as code, design specifications, deployment scripts, and more. The program utilizes Ollama models and a directed graph (via NetworkX) to model the interactions between different departments (agents).

## Features

- **Agent-based Workflow**: Simulates different tech company departments (e.g., Product Management, Design, Engineering).
- **Directed Graph Processing**: Uses NetworkX to define the flow of data between agents.
- **Ollama Integration**: Employs locally hosted models for generating agent-specific outputs.
- **Iterative Processing**: Refines outputs across iterations until the workflow is complete.
- **Progress Persistence**: Logs intermediate and final outputs to files.
- **Custom Prompt Support**: Accepts a structured prompt from an external file (`initial_prompt.txt`).

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies**:
  - networkx
  - json

Ensure that Ollama is installed and the required models are downloaded locally.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kliewerdaniel/orchestrator-ollama.git
   cd orchestrator-ollama
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Use pip to install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Usage

### Step 1: Prepare Your Initial Prompt

Create an `initial_prompt.txt` file in the root directory. The prompt should be a JSON-formatted dictionary containing:

- **message**: The initial idea or requirements.
- **code**: Leave this as an empty string (`""`) initially.
- **readme**: Leave this as an empty string (`""`) initially.

Example `initial_prompt.txt`:

```json
{
    "message": "Develop a platform that connects freelancers with clients using AI for project matching.",
    "code": "",
    "readme": ""
}
```

### Step 2: Run the Program

Execute the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Review the Outputs

The program generates the following files:

- **output.txt**: Contains the intermediate outputs after each iteration.
- **final_output.txt**: Contains the final output, including the message, code, and readme.

## Workflow

The program simulates the workflow of a tech company by processing the prompt through the following agents:

1. **Product Management**: Expands the initial idea into detailed product requirements.
2. **Design**: Creates UI/UX specifications, including wireframes and style guides.
3. **Engineering**: Develops the software application based on the specifications.
4. **Testing**: Generates comprehensive test cases for quality assurance.
5. **Security**: Analyzes and enhances the security of the application.
6. **DevOps**: Creates deployment scripts and CI/CD pipelines.
7. **Final Agent**: Verifies if the project is complete or requires further refinement.

The agents are connected in a directed graph, ensuring an organized flow of information between departments.

## Customizing Agents

### Modify Agent Behavior

Each agent has its own Python file (e.g., `engineering.py`, `design.py`) where you can adjust:

- The prompts sent to the Ollama model.
- The processing logic for outputs.

### Add New Agents

To add a new agent, create a new Python module in the agents directory and integrate it into the directed graph in the main script.

## Troubleshooting


- **NetworkX Errors**: Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly.
- **JSON Parsing Issues**: Check that `initial_prompt.txt` is properly formatted as JSON.

## Future Improvements

- **Parallel Execution**: Allow parallel execution of agents where applicable.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve robustness by adding retries and better error reporting.
- **Interactive CLI**: Provide a command-line interface for easier customization of inputs and parameters.
- **Integration Testing**: Add tests to validate the functionality of each agent and the overall workflow.
