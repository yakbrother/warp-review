# Quick Start: Warp Review

## 1. Run the Orchestrator

```bash
python pr_review_orchestrator.py
```

## 2. Follow the Workflow

The orchestrator will guide you through 4 agents:

### Agent 1: PR Status
**What it does:** Analyzes your branch and changed files

**Steps:**
1. Read the prompt: `cat .pr_review/prstatus_prompt.txt`
2. In Warp Agent Mode, ask me to process this prompt
3. I'll analyze your PR status and changed files
4. Save my response to: `.pr_review/prstatus_output.txt`
5. Press Enter to continue

### Agent 2: Test Coverage
**What it does:** Identifies test gaps in your changes

**Steps:**
1. Read the prompt: `cat .pr_review/testcoverage_prompt.txt`
2. In Warp Agent Mode, ask me to process this prompt
3. I'll identify what tests are needed and why
4. Save my response to: `.pr_review/testcoverage_output.txt`
5. Press Enter to continue

### Agent 3: Accessibility
**What it does:** Reviews WCAG 2.1 compliance (if UI changes)

**Steps:**
1. Read the prompt: `cat .pr_review/accessibility_prompt.txt`
2. In Warp Agent Mode, ask me to process this prompt
3. I'll check accessibility issues
4. Save my response to: `.pr_review/accessibility_output.txt`
5. Press Enter to continue

### Agent 4: Final Checks
**What it does:** Creates comprehensive pre-PR checklist

**Steps:**
1. Read the prompt: `cat .pr_review/finalchecks_prompt.txt`
2. In Warp Agent Mode, ask me to process this prompt
3. I'll compile everything into action items
4. Save my response to: `.pr_review/finalchecks_output.txt`

## 3. Act on Findings

After the review:
- [ ] Address critical test gaps
- [ ] Fix accessibility issues
- [ ] Run linter/formatter
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Review commit messages

## 4. Create/Update PR

Use the generated PR description from `.pr_review/finalchecks_output.txt`

## Tips

- **Save outputs as you go** - each agent builds on previous analysis
- **Process in order** - agents are designed to work sequentially
- **Re-run specific agents** if you make changes
- **Use in Warp Agent Mode** - that's what the prompts are designed for

## Example Session

```bash
# Start the review
python pr_review_orchestrator.py

# For each agent:
cat .pr_review/prstatus_prompt.txt  # Read prompt
# [Process in Warp Agent Mode]
# [Save output to prstatus_output.txt]
# [Press Enter]

# Repeat for each agent

# Review final checklist
cat .pr_review/finalchecks_output.txt
```

## File Structure

```
.pr_review/
├── prstatus_prompt.txt          # Generated by orchestrator
├── prstatus_output.txt          # Your saved response
├── testcoverage_prompt.txt      # Generated by orchestrator
├── testcoverage_output.txt      # Your saved response
├── accessibility_prompt.txt      # Generated by orchestrator
├── accessibility_output.txt     # Your saved response
├── finalchecks_prompt.txt       # Generated by orchestrator
└── finalchecks_output.txt       # Your saved response
```

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The orchestrator can't find my changes**
- Make sure you've committed your changes
- Check you're on the correct branch
- Verify git remote is configured

**Q: How do I process prompts in Warp Agent Mode?**
- Copy the prompt text from the `.txt` file
- Paste it in Warp and ask me to process it
- I'll provide the analysis
- Save my response to the corresponding output file

**Q: Can I skip an agent?**
- Yes, just press Enter without saving output
- The next agent will work with available context

**Q: Do I need to run all agents?**
- PR Status and Test Coverage are recommended
- Accessibility only if you have UI changes
- Final Checks pulls everything together
